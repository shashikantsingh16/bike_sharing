# Project Name
> Boom Bikes Linear Regression Problem

## Table of Contents
* [General Info](# We have used MLR model to predict rental bike demand based on the factors provided.)
* [Technologies Used](# Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Statsmodel )
* [Conclusions](# We have identified 11 independent variables from the dataset to predict the demand for the Sharing bikes)

## General Information

We have utilized the Linear Regression model to predict the demand for the rental bikes. The model can be used by the business in forcasting the demand and prepare the business to plan in advance. 
Business can use this model to predict, plan and expand to other market based on the factors considered.



## Conclusions
1.	Summer and winter have more demands
2.	Holidays - Holidays the demand becomes higher.
3.	People not to prefer renting the bikes when the weather is favourable such as light rain.
